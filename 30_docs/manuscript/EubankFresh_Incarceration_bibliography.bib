annote = {Definition:

An institution is a relatively enduring collection of rules and organized practices, embedded in structures of meaning and resources that are relatively invariant in the face of turnover of individuals and relatively resilient to the idiosyncratic preferences and expectations of individuals and changing external circumstances (March and Olsen 1989, 1995). ~


Notes:
	{\textbullet}	The organized setting in which political actors act. ~
	{\textbullet}	Institutions are inherently endogenous; institutions are constructed by society but in turn influence the society in which they operate
	{\textbullet}	Formal-legal framework to the behavioral revolution
	{\textbullet}	Variation in institutions is responsible for some of the variation in political processes and outcomes
	{\textbullet}	One fundamental question: how do we characterize and define institutions independent of the outcomes that they produce? ~What is the institution of property rights? ~What does it look like? ~How do we know what rules, structures and organizations produce a respect of private property? ~Or do we only know whether a country respects private property or does not?
	{\textbullet}	Concrete political institutions: the legislative, executive, bureaucracy, judiciary, and the electoral system
	{\textbullet}	Functionalism: history is efficient, it creates the institution that is needed
	{\textbullet}	Do institutions solve problems? ~If so, if the nature of the problem changes, does the institution change as well?
	{\textbullet}	Institutions are defended by those operating inside of them and validated by those operating outside, making their practices encoded in rules and routines and ensuring that they cannot be changed arbitrarily
	{\textbullet}	Through what processes do institutions matter?
	{\textbullet}	Under what conditions do institutions matter?
	{\textbullet}	Why do institutions make a difference?
	{\textbullet}	Institutions organize a polity: they affect how authority and power is constituted, exercised, legitimated, controlled and redistributed
	{\textbullet}	Empower (Enable) and constrain political actors
	{\textbullet}	Focusing a lot on how identity is shaped by institutions
	{\textbullet}	Institutions do change (most theories agree) but they do so neither instantaneously nor in a way that is always optimal, they don{\textquoteright}t just adjust and become efficient in the face of changing conditions
	{\textbullet}	How do institutions change? ~Or begin:
	{\textopenbullet}	Single-Actor Design: Single actors or collectives defined as such specify designs to achieve some pretty well-specified objectives
	{\textopenbullet}	Conflict Design: Multiple actors pursue different objectives and the design reflects the outcomes of political trading and power
	{\textopenbullet}	Learning Design: Actors adapt ~to designs and thus affect or change them as a result of feedback to themselves or borrowing from others
	{\textopenbullet}	Competitive Selection: Unvarying rules and other institutional elements are in competition for survival and reproduction, and so institutions adapt or die out given that there other institutional options available~
	{\textbullet}	Constitutions limit the legitimacy of redesign
	{\textbullet}	Adaptability may work well in redesigning institutions along the way, reducing the actual need for redesign
	{\textbullet}	Punctuated Equilibrium: Long periods of stability followed by fast discontinuous change (critical junctures of radical change)
	{\textbullet}	**To what extent does revolution represent a critical juncture in institutional persistence? ~To answer this question, we need a definition of revolution that is not dependent on institutional change. ~Armed and semi-organized conflict against the~existing political establishment. ~
	{\textbullet}	A focus on critical junctures may underestimate the incremental steps that ultimately~produce transformative results
	{\textbullet}	How do political systems deal with diversity: institutional specialization, separation, autonomy, sequential attention, local rationality (?), and conflict avoidance
	{\textbullet}	Argues that the rules routines and norms of an institution are the basic units of analysis in the new institutionalism, not (rational) individuals
	{\textbullet}	Political science to a large extent is based on the study of the sovereign, territorial state (and the Westphalian state-system)
	{\textbullet}	How does political action translate into institutional change?
	{\textbullet}	How does an existing institutional order impact the dynamics of change?
