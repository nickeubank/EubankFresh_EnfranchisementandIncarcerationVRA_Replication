		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This study contains data on the attitudes of 1,374 American 
 men aged 16-64 toward violence in 1969. The study was undertaken 
 to examine the levels of violence that can be viewed as justified 
 to bring about social control or social change. Also emphasized 
 were the role of the respondents' personal values, their definitions 
 of violence, and their identification with the groups involved in 
 violence. Some of the open-ended questions in the structured interview 
 probed the respondents' general concerns, their attitudes toward 
 violence, and their views on the causes of and ways of preventing 
 violence. In questions grouped into categories of "violence for social 
 control" and "violence for social change", respondents were asked to 
 react to situations involving protests and other disturbances such as 
 hoodlum gang disturbances, students' protests, and Black protest 
 demonstrations. Repondents' opinions were sought on the appropriate 
 police actions in these situations and the frequency with which 
 certain control measures should be utilized. Respondents were also
 asked in three different situations whether they believed change 
 could be effected without action involving property damage or injury, 
 or if change could only be effected with protests in which some people 
 were killed. Demographic variables describe age, sex, date of birth, 
 nationality, occupation, education, religion, and family income. A 
 supplementary sample of Black men is also included in this study in 
order to permit separate analysis on the basis of race.</span></p>
