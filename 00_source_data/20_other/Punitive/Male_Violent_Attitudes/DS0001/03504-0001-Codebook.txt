                 RESPONSE RATE WAS OBTAINED YIELDING 1374 COMPLETED INTER-     
                 VIEWS.  THIS NUMBER INCLUDES A SUPPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF        
                 BLACKS TO PERMIT SEPARATE ANALYSIS ON THE BASIS OF RACE.      
                                                                               
                     TO EXAMINE THE DEGREE OF VIOLENCE WHICH AMERICAN MEN      
                 FELT COULD BE JUSTIFIED FOR SOCIAL CONTROL, THE RESPONDENTS   
                 WERE ASKED TO REACT TO SITUATIONS INVOLVING PROTESTS AND      
                 OTHER DISTURBANCES.  THESE SITUATIONS INCLUDED HOODLUM GANG   
                 DISTURBANCES, STUDENT PROTESTS AND BLACK PROTEST DEMONSTRA-   
                 TIONS.  THE QUESTIONS DEALT WITH APPROPRIATE POLICE ACTIONS   
                 IN THESE SITUATIONS AND THE RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED THE        
                 FREQUENCY WITH WHICH CERTAIN CONTROL MEASURES SHOULD BE       
                 UTILIZED.  THESE ACTIONS RANGED FROM HAVING THE POLICE "LET   
                 IT GO" TO HAVING THE POLICE "SHOOT TO KILL".  THESE VAR-      
                 IABLES WERE COMBINED INTO AN INDEX CALLED "VIOLENCE FOR       
                 SOCIAL CONTROL".                                              
                                                                               
                     IN QUESTIONS DEALING WITH THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE NEC-      
                 ESSARY TO BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE FAST ENOUGH, THE RESPON-  
                 DENTS WERE ASKED IN THREE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WHETHER THEY   
                 AGREED WITH STATEMENTS RANGING FROM "CHANGE CAN BE MADE...    
                 WITHOUT ACTION INVOLVING PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURY" TO        
                 "PROTEST IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE KILLED WILL BE NECESSARY    
                 BEFORE CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE".  THESE SITUATIONS INCLUDED   
                 BLACK PROTESTS, STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS, AND CHANGE IN         
                 GENERAL.  THESE ITEMS WERE COMBINED INTO AN INDEX CALLED      
                 "VIOLENCE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE".                                 
                                                                               
                     THE STRUCTURED INTERVIEW SCHEDULE CONTAINED BOTH CLOSED   
                 AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS.  SOME OF THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS   
                 ASKED ABOUT THE RESPONDENT'S GENERAL CONCERNS, HIS CONCERN    
                 ABOUT VIOLENCE AND HIS VIEWS ON THE CAUSES OF AND WAYS OF     
                 PREVENTING VIOLENCE.  ALSO INCLUDED WAS A SEMANTIC DIFFER-    
                 ENTIAL SCALE WHICH PROBED THE RESPONDENT'S DEFINITION OF      
                 VIOLENCE BY HAVING HIM JUDGE THE RELATIVE APPROPRIATENESS OF  
                                                                               
                                              II                               
                                                                               
                 VARIOUS ADJECTIVE PAIRS SUCH AS "VALUABLE-WORTHLESS" TO THE   
                 WORD "VIOLENCE".  MORE DIRECT DEFINITIONAL QUESTIONS WERE     
                 ALSO ASKED SUCH AS, "DO YOU THINK OF POLICE BEATING STUDENTS  
                 AS VIOLENCE?"                                                 
                                                                               
                     THE PERSONAL VALUES TO WHICH THE RESPONDENT SUBSCRIBES    
                 WERE ALSO PROBED IN QUESTIONS WHICH ASKED THE RESPONDENT TO   
                 AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO KILL IN  
                 SELF DEFENSE, RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE, KINDNESS, ETC.  THE        
                 RESPONDENT WAS ALSO ASKED TO RANK SEVERAL CONCEPTS SUCH AS    
                 "EQUALITY", "FREEDOM", "RESPECT FOR LAW", AND "FINANCIAL      
                 SECURITY" FROM "MOST IMPORTANT" TO "LEAST IMPORTANT".         
                                                                               
                     THE RESPONDENT'S IDENTIFICATION WITH WHITE STUDENT        
                 DEMONSTRATORS, BLACK PROTESTERS, AND POLICE WAS MEASURED IN   
                 SEVERAL QUESTIONS (E.G., "WOULD YOU SAY THAT <THEY> CAN BE    
                 TRUSTED...?" AND "...IF <THEY> GET THE THINGS THEY WANT DO    
                 YOU THINK YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE?  <HOW?>)".                   
                                                                               
                     THE RESPONDENT'S BACKGROUND WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED FOR     
                 ITS RELATION TO HIS ATTITUDES TOWARD VIOLENCE.  THE BACK-     
                 GROUND VARIABLES ESTABLISH THE RESPONDENT'S AGE, RACE,        
                 INCOME, MARITAL STATUS, AND RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE.  THIS       
                 SECTION ALSO GATHERS INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESPONDENT'S       
                 MEMBERSHIP IN ORGANIZATIONS, MILITARY SERVICE, OCCUPATION,    
                 EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND EXPERIENCES IN SOUTHERN AND URBAN       
                 SETTINGS.  HIS PARENT'S RELIGION, SOCIO-ECONOMIC LEVEL AND    
                 COUNTRY OF ORIGIN WAS ALSO ASCERTAINED.                       
                                                                               
                     THERE WAS SOME UNDERRESPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE FROM LARGE  
                 CITIES AND EASTERN STATES.  HOWEVER, FURTHER EXAMINATION      
                 INDICATED THAT INCORPORATION OF A SET OF WEIGHTS TO CORRECT   
                 THIS SITUATION WAS NOT WARRANTED.                             
                                                                               
                     CODING RELIABILITY WAS REPORTED IN TERMS OF "PERCENTAGE   
                 AGREEMENT" BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CODER AND A CHECK CODER MORE  
                 CENTRALLY INVOLVED IN THE STUDY.  THE PROPORTION OF INTER-    
                 VIEWS CHECK-CODED RANGED FROM 6-28%, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE    
                 OF QUESTION.  RELIABILITY AGREEMENT FOR CLOSED QUESTIONS WAS  
                 99+% AND FOR OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS, 90%.

                 PERSONS LIVING IN GROUP QUARTERS, INSTITUTIONAL POPULATIONS,

                 BY RACE WITHIN A DESIRED TOTAL SAMPLE OF 1400 RESPONDENTS,    
                 IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SOME OVER-SAMPLING OF BLACKS TAKE       
                 PLACE.  TWO PROCEDURES WERE ADOPTED TO ACHIEVE THIS END:

                     THE PRIMARY CROSS-SECTION SAMPLE CONSISTED OF DWELLING    
                 UNITS SELECTED WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY (1/25,850) IN THE       
                 APPROXIMATELY 620 SEGMENTS (SMALL COMPACT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS)   
                 OF THE SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER'S NATIONAL SAMPLE OF DWELL-     
                 INGS.  THIS SAMPLE WAS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL DWELL-

                 ARY SEGMENTS LOCATED NEAR THE PRIMARY SEGMENTS.  ONE SECOND-  
                 ARY SEGMENT WAS IDENTIFIED FOR EACH PRIMARY SEGMENT, AND      
                 SAMPLING IN THE SECONDARY SEGMENT OCCURRED ONLY IF IT SEEMED  
                 LIKELY THAT IT WOULD CONTAIN BLACK HOUSEHOLDS.

                 VIEW ATTEMPTED.  IN BLACK HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH THE PRIMARY AND  
                 THE SECONDARY SEGMENTS, INTERVIEWS WERE ATTEMPTED WITH ALL    
                 ELIGIBLE RESPONDENTS.  (ONE PERSON WAS DESIGNATED THE         
                 PRINCIPAL RESPONDENT ONLY IN THE PRIMARY SEGMENTS, HOWEVER.)  
                 NO INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN NON-BLACK HOUSEHOLD LOCATED

                     THE SAMPLING AND FIELD WORK YIELDED 304 INTERVIEWS WITH   
                 BLACK RESPONDENTS, AND 1070 INTERVIEWS WITH NON-BLACK         
                 RESPONDENTS.

                     AS A RESULT OF THE SAMPLING PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE,   
                 SIX CATEGORIES OF RESPONDENTS WERE DISTINGUISHED.  SINCE THE  
                 RESPONDENTS IN EACH OF THE CATEGORIES WERE SELECTED WITH      
                 DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES, IT WAS NECESSARY TO WEIGHT THEM      
                 DIFFERENTIALLY DURING ANALYSIS.  THE CATEGORIES AND THEIR     
                 RESPECTIVE WEIGHTS APPEAR IN THE TABLE BELOW.  THE SAMPLING   
                 WEIGHT FOR EACH RESPONDENT OCCURS IN REF. NO. 3.  THIS

                     IN THE NORMAL SITUATION, WHERE A DIFFERENT RANK VALUE IN  
                 THE RANGE 1-6 IS INDICATED FOR EACH ITEM A-F, THE CODING WAS  
                 STRAIGHTFORWARD AND AS SHOWN IN THE CODEBOOK.

                 WERE IMPUTED FOR THE REMAINING ITEMS BASED ON WHATEVER IN-    
                 FORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.  THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING    
                 THE IMPUTATION WERE THAT THE SUM OF THE ASSIGNED RANKS        
                 (ACROSS ITEMS A-F) SHOULD EQUAL 21 (WITHIN LIMITS OF ROUND-   
                 ING), AND "TIED" ITEMS WOULD HAVE THE SAME RANK.

                     INCONSISTENT.                                             
                                                                               
                                                                               
                     A WIDE VARIETY OF RESPONSE PATTERNS WOULD BE CONSIDERED

                     RESPONSES WERE TREATED AS ONE VALUE, THAT IS , IF THE     
                     CATEGORIES WERE COLLAPSED.  (EG.,  B THROUGH E CODED      
                     '2', '1', '4' AND '3' RESPECTIVELY)                       
                 2.  TWO ADJACENT "ALMOST ALWAYS" RESPONSES.  (EG. B           
                     THROUGH E CODED '4', '4', '3' AND '2', RESPECTIVELY)      
                 3.  NO RESTRICTION TO ITEM "B" IF THE RESPONSE TO ITEM "E"    
                     IS "ALMOST ALWAYS".  (EG. B THROUGH E CODED '3', '3',     
                     '3', AND '4', RESPECTIVELY) (RELAXATION OF PRIMARY RULE   
                     #2)                                                       
                 4.  THE RESPONSE PATTERN FAILED PRIMARY RULE #1, BUT WOULD    
                     MEET THE RULE IF CONTIGUOUS "HARDLY EVER" AND "SOMETIMES" 
                     RESPONSES WERE TREATED AS ONE VALUE, THAT IS, IF THE      
                     CATEGORIES WERE COLLAPSED.  (EG., B THROUGH E CODED       
                     '2', '3', '2', AND '4', RESPECTIVELY)                     
                 5.  THREE ADJACENT "ALMOST ALWAYS" RESPONSES.  (EG. B         
                     THROUGH E CODED '2', '4', '4' AND '4', RESPECTIVELY).     
                                                                               
                     CASES IN WHICH THREE OR MORE ITEMS WERE ANSWERED BUT      
                 WHICH FAILED TO MEET THE PRIMARY RULES AND DID NOT FALL INTO  
                 ONE OF THE EXEMPTIONS FOR MINOR INCONSISTENCIES, WERE CODED   
                 '3'  (MAJOR INCONSISTENCY) IN THE INCONSISTENCY SUMMARY
