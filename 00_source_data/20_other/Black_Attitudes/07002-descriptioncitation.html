								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This study is part of the University of California's
Five-Year Study of anti-Semitism in the United States. As a result of
the outbreak of Black rioting during the summer of 1964, it was
decided to expand the proposed Black subsample of the national sample
to a larger Black oversample in order to study the climate of opinion
in the Black American community. These Black respondents were
selected by drawing five samples: one general metropolitan sample and
four urban samples from Chicago, New York, Atlanta, and Birmingham.
Questions were asked about the respondents' present economic and
social positions as well as the economic and social conditions in
their childhood. Respondents' opinions on civil rights issues as well
as attitudes toward authority and treatment of Blacks in the existing
system were investigated. A section of the questionnaire was devoted
to the respondents' attitudes toward Jews and other groups.</span></p>
