Section 1: File Specifications
   This section assigns local macros to the necessary files.
   Please edit:
        "data-filename" ==> The name of data file downloaded from ICPSR
        "dictionary-filename" ==> The name of the dictionary file downloaded.
        "stata-datafile" ==> The name you wish to call your Stata data file.

   Note:  We assume that the raw data, dictionary, and setup (this do file) all
          reside in the same directory (or folder).  If that is not the case
          you will need to include paths as well as filenames in the macros.
